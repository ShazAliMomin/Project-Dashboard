Project Made By: Shaz Ali Momin, Neha Ali, Arsh Ali and Raian Momin.

This project was made as a part of the Code Red: Artemis Hackathon. 

Our project is a web dashboard desgined to display information provided by HCSS. Information
includes project details such as budget costs and actual costs for labor, equipment, and materials as well as employee info, etc.

We chose to display the statistics primarily in the graph, with sub-details written out on other elements. We used a multitude of programs and langauges such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 

We intended to create different kinds of graphs for each project. However, due to time and programming issues, we couldn't get to that point. We settled with showing the main aspects in the form of a bar graph.
